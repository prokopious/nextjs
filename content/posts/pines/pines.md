My engine was smoking the other day, so I pulled into Walgreens and opened the hood.  A burly gentleman walked up and said:

> I can see that you live amongst the pines.

When I asked him to clarify what he'd said, he pointed towards the pine needles on my windshield. He said that although he wasn't a mechanic, he, too, lived in a pine forest, albeit deep in the West Virginia mountains.
